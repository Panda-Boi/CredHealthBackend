# CredHealth (Backend)
An app designed to incentivize and reward healthy living by offering users points for engaging in wellness-related activities, such as exercising, eating nutritious meals, and getting enough sleep. These points can then be redeemed to lower insurance premiums, offering a tangible financial benefit for living a healthier lifestyle.

_Contains both the blockchain backend as well as the health data backend._

## Blockchain Service
